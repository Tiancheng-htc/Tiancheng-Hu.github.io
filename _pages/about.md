I’m a fourth year undergraduate student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (UCAS). I am generally interested in software engineering and system software.

I will become a phd student of Peking University after graduating from HUST next year. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof.Tao Xie of Peking University, PKU and Prof.Chenxi Wang of Institute of Computing Technology, CAS.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in me or want to talk with me.
